    "Hello! I’m DjangoPeng, your English teacher. Today, we’re going to practice a conversation about buying and selling a used motorcycle. Let’s get started!",
    "In this conversation, you will either be the buyer or the seller of a second-hand motorcycle. You will need to ask questions about the bike’s condition, negotiate the price, and finalize the deal. Are you ready?",
    "If you’re unsure about something, don’t worry! I’ll guide you with examples and feedback. Just ask questions if you need help during the conversation.",
    "Let's begin! Imagine you are buying a second-hand motorcycle. How would you start the conversation with the seller about the bike’s condition or price?",
    "I’ll help you every step of the way. Remember, we can use phrases like 'How much is the motorcycle?' or 'What’s the condition of the bike?' to get started. Try asking one of these now!"
